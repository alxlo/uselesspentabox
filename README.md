===============
A useless box with moody behaviour.

### What is it?
Well, basically it is just a pimped [The Most Useless Machine "Leave Me Alone" Box](http://www.fablabshop.de/anleitunguseless) from [Fab Lab Shop](http://www.fablabshop.de).

### Why is it special?
It's less predictable and shows a variety of different behaviours.

I ignored probably all  of the original instructions for wiring things up and built only the mechanical part according to the original building instructions. Instead of dismantling the servo and making it just run forward or backward (or not at all) depending on the position of the switches, the servo is left intact and a microcontroller is used to control the servo with a PWM signal.

This allows for more variable and precise movements of the arm for switching the main switch off again, and greatly enchances the capability to make the box express different behaviours (or degrees of annoyance about beeing disturbed).

### How?
A defective [pentabug](https://github.com/c3d2/pentabug) PCB has been recycled for this box but the circuit contains only a few components and can be easily build on some PCB prototyping board.
